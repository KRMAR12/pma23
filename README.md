# PMA23

This repository is managed by the students of group PMA23 at Lviv National University named after Ivan Franko. The group primarily works with Python for their projects and assignments. Each student has a designated folder in the main branch named after their first name and last name, where they store all their completed Python tasks and projects. Additionally, each student has their own branch where they can work individually on Python-related tasks.

## Folder Structure

In the main branch, the repository is organized as follows:

- `name1_lastname1/`: Folder for Student 1 (First Name, Last Name)
  - Contains all completed Python tasks and projects of Student 1.
- `name2_lastname2/`: Folder for Student 2 (First Name, Last Name)
  - Contains all completed Python tasks and projects of Student 2.
- ...

## Student Branches

Each student has their own individual branch where they can work on Python tasks and projects. The naming convention for these branches follows the pattern: `student_name_lastname`.

### Working on Your Python Tasks

1. Create a new branch using the format: `student_name_lastname`.
2. Work on your Python tasks and projects in this branch.
3. Push your changes to your branch regularly.

### Merging to Main Branch

When you have completed your Python tasks and are ready to merge, follow these steps:

1. Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
2. Request a review from your peers or project coordinator.
3. Address any feedback or comments and make necessary adjustments.
4. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the main branch.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Coordinate and communicate with your fellow students to avoid conflicts.
- Encourage sharing of knowledge and collaboration within the group.
